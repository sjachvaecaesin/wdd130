        My name is Nikolai. It’s actually my middle name, but that’s what I’m called. When I was young, my father introduced my brother and me to Dungeons and Dragons. One of my first characters was an elf who was stealthy. The game materials had alphabets for dragons and dwarves, along with some vocabulary. In the course of studying the dragon vocabulary, I was looking for a way to describe an elf who hides in the shadows and I came up with my character’s name: Sjachvaecaesin.

        Now, years later, I occasionally play Dungeons and Dragons, but I am more often engaged in online gaming. I have chosen, for my screen name, Sjachvaecaesin. While online, I make many friends. In fact, I recently attended a wedding for 2 of my friends that I met online. I had to travel to another state to attend the wedding, so my parents wanted to meet the couple ahead of time. It was no surprise to my parents that my friends knew me as Sjach.
