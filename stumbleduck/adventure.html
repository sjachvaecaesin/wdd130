                    The finding from the kobold clerics
            You obtained the pelts from the kobold clerics. Amongst those pelts were crude maps of the area. Each map clearly identified Stumbleduck at the base of the mountains. Some maps identified Flauximm, as well. Some maps identified a location SW of Stumbleduck, which has been determined to be the caves in which the pelts were found. Some maps identified a location in the lower elevations of the mountains N of Portage. Some maps identified a location in the lower elevations of the mountains NE of Stumbleduck, NW of the 5 Towns, and somewhat E of the origin of the major river that flows from the mountains.
            Amongst those pelts were also writings of the clerics. Some speak of the history surrounding the founding of the city Flauximm. Others speak of the struggles of the kobolds. Yet others speak of fulfillment of prophecy and of a new threat rising.
            That new threat that has emerged is the White Dragon Wyrmling, Flauxorr, son of the White Dragon, Flauximm. Piecing together the histories, the struggles, and the prophecies, a sketch of the events has been shared with your group. It appears that the White Dragon, Flauximm, had one egg kept in his mountain-lair. When the adventurer Harfindril led his attack against Flauximm, the kobold minions of Flauximm were directed to take the egg to safety. They apparently took the egg through passages through the mountain lair that were heretofore unknown to Harfindril and company and hid it in the mountains. The exact location has not been identified, though the best suppositions are that it would be one of the 3 locations previously identified as being marked on the various maps.
            There was some disconnect due to the fact that the incubation period for the egg of a dragon is considerably less than the century and a half since the demise of Flauximm, yet it seems that Flauxorr has only recently (within the past 3 years) hatched. It appears that the kobold clerics and sorcerers have spent all that time preserving the egg until they could find a way to bring it to maturity. There were many writings that referenced Kurtulmak, the Kobold demigod, and Garl Glittergold, the gnomish god who destroyed the marvelous Kobold city of Darastrixhurthi and trapped Kurtulmak in a labyrinth. There were other writings wherein the sorcerers laid blame for the demise of their beloved Flauximm upon the head of the gnome named Stumbleduck. There were other writing wherein the priests gained divine guidance from Kurtulmak in how to preserve the egg, in exchange for the commitment that the kobolds would raise the inhabitant of the egg to be named Flauxorr, son of Flauximm, and destroyer of Stumbleduck.
            Some of the pelts identified the recent goings-on within the kobold community. It appears that Flauxorr has a voracious appetite, which initially depleted the kobold community of many of its numbers, and that Flauxorr, knowing his heritage and destiny, has been a hard task-master. So much so that there has been a need to crack down on unnamed dissident members of the kobold community. In short, while the bulk of the kobolds have pledged their lives to Flauxorr, there are those who feel that life was better before the egg hatched.
