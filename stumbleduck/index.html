                    Concept of Stumbleduck
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Stumbleduck is the setting for a Dungeons & Dragons adventuring campaign. The concept was designed to allow adventuring parties to have choice in their progress from 1st to 20th level. There are multiple hooks that will draw groups into adventure. Some of the lower level hooks will lead them into the city, others will lead them into the wild, and yet others will lead them into the sea, the mountains, or someplace dark. Upon satisfying the initial adventure, and obtaining a mid-range level, the group will once again find that there are multiple hooks that will draw them into adventure. Do they return to the same setting and deepen their experience, or do they branch off into another part of the land?

                <h2>
                    How can this help DMs?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Stumbleduck was designed to be able to be complete; an entire world that is laid out for the DM so that nothing needs to be created. But it was also designed to be able to provide flexibility for the DM, allowing the adventuring party to begin the adventure underground, or at sea, or in the mountains, or wherever they like, then progressing to any of those environments as they level up. But it was also designed to allow the DM to exercise creativity by determining what will be found just past the borders of the map. If the group heads into the uncharted sea, what do they find? Or, what might be found deep in the unexplored marshes? In the uninhabitable desert? Deep in the caverns leading to the Underdark?
                    Stumbleduck could be used as written, a complete adventure, or it could simply be the foundation of a homeland that the adventurers leave, hoping to return safely with tales of what lies beyond.

                    What character levels is Stumbleduck appropriate for?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As designed, Stumbleduck provides the DM with everything needed to take an adventuring group from level 1 to level 20, and to do so multiple times without repeating the same adventure.
